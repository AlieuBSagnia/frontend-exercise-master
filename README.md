## :wrench: Task 

We would like you to build a responsive news article as per the included designs. You should meet the [ACs](#scroll-acceptance-criteria).

We've built a bare-bones [express](https://expressjs.com/) application with some basic front-end tooling ([webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for JavaScript compilation and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) for CSS concatenation). It uses [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) as a simple templating language.

Your code should work in modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Edge. Do not worry about supporting IE11 or below.

You should not spend more than 3 hours on this task. We are not expecting a fully functioning masterpiece in this time :)
For everything you are not able to complete, please submit with a list of what you would have done with more time and/or write `// TODO`s throughout your code.

### :mega: Requirements

* Match the [designs](#art-designs) as closely as possible, filling in any gaps as you deem fit
* Application should be fully responsive
* Pass the [ACs](#scroll-acceptance-criteria)
* Ensure code is unit tested. We've set this up with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) but feel free to use whatever you like
* The article and related posts JSON calls should be made server side (example integration of `meta.json` included)
* Comments should be called once the DOM is ready via [this endpoint](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/telegraph/frontend-exercise/comments). This call should be made client-side and injected with JavaScript
* Keep your JavaScript vanilla please :icecream:

### :mag_right: What we are looking for

* An understanding of web fundamentals
* A consistent and scalable approach to the test
* An understanding of accessibility
* Reasoning about web performance
* Reasoning about SEO
* Solid unit testing
* Ability to translate designs into code

### :open_file_folder: Data

* Article data: `server/content/article.json`
* Posts: `server/content/posts.json`
* Meta: `server/content/meta.json`
* Comments: [https://my-json-server.typicode.com/telegraph/frontend-exercise/comments](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/telegraph/frontend-exercise/comments)

### :art: Designs

* The designs can be found in the `design` directory in the root of the project.
* The font in the design file is a custom font so feel free to use whichever font you like (ideally not webdings).

## :floppy_disk: Set up

Firstly, install all of the packages:

```sh
npm install
```

Then run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your web browser and you *should* see a blank webpage with The Telegraph logo and a 'Hello World' message.

The above command will watch and deploy your code. The watchers for CSS and JS files will not take into account changes to new files so make sure you restart the watchers when adding new files. The CSS watcher will only look for changes inside a directory which sits within the `src/css` directory (e.g. `src/css/elements`).
